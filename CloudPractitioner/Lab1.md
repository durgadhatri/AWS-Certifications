# Lab 01: Introduction to the AWS Console and Global Infrastructure 

## Section 1: Basics of Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, organizations can access technology services such as computing power, storage, and databases on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS).

The core characteristics of cloud computing include on-demand self-service, broad network access, resource pooling, rapid elasticity, and measured service. This means users can provision resources whenever needed, access them over the internet, scale up or down automatically, and only pay for what they use.

In traditional infrastructure, companies invest heavily upfront in physical hardware and data centers. This requires long provisioning times, dedicated IT staff, and often leads to overprovisioning or underutilization. In contrast, cloud infrastructure allows businesses to scale resources instantly, reduce operational overhead, and respond quickly to changing demands.

**Cloud environments are generally classified into four types:**

- Public Cloud: Services are delivered over the internet and shared across multiple customers (e.g., AWS).

- Private Cloud: Infrastructure is used exclusively by a single organization, often hosted on-premises or in a private data center.

- Hybrid Cloud: A mix of public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them.

- Community Cloud: Shared infrastructure between organizations with common concerns, such as regulatory requirements or industry standards.

**There are three primary cloud service models:**

- **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** provides virtualized computing resources like servers, storage, and networking. Users manage the operating systems and applications, while the provider manages the infrastructure.

- **Platform as a Service (PaaS)** offers a platform with tools and services that allow developers to build, test, and deploy applications without managing the underlying hardware or operating systems.

- **Software as a Service (SaaS)** delivers complete software applications over the internet. Users access the software through a browser or app, while the provider handles all maintenance, updates, and infrastructure.

Cloud computing offers several important benefits. It improves cost efficiency by eliminating the need for large upfront investments in hardware. It enhances speed and agility, allowing organizations to innovate faster by provisioning resources in minutes.

With the cloud, companies can take advantage of global scale, deploying applications and services across multiple regions worldwide to reduce latency and serve customers closer to their location. Reliability is improved through redundancy and disaster recovery strategies built into cloud platforms.

Security is another major benefit. Leading cloud providers like AWS follow rigorous security and compliance protocols, offering services like encryption, identity management, and threat detection to protect customer data. Finally, elasticity allows systems to automatically scale up or down based on demand, optimizing both performance and cost.
